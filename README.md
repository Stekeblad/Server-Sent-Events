# Server Sent Events in an Optimizely CMS Admin Tool

[.NET 10 Preview 3 made it easier to use Server sent events](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/10.0/preview/preview3/aspnetcore.md#support-for-server-sent-events-sse)
and since reading about it I have been wanting to try it out with an Optimizely CMS admin tool.

Here is a diff of what has been added onto the Alloy template:
